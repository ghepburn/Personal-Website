www.greghepburn.com is a full-stack web application professionally representing myself and my completed projects.

#Frontend
The frontend is built using ReactJs, HTML5, and CSS. Instead of calling “react-create-project” using npm, webpack and babel are configured manually.  “npm collect” is called to compile and transport ReactJs code to backend static file.   

#Backend
The backend is built using Django and Django Rest Framework. Django models are created and made accessible to the frontend via a DRF REST api. Route security is configured via DRF. Django pre-configured admin page is used to manually add, edit and remove data for the frontend. 

#Improvements
-	The frontend ReactJS code is not optimized for reusability and could make better use of ReactJS features to abstract reusable components.  
-	The frontend CSS is good but is not complete.  Contact section is an example where visual appeal could be improved
